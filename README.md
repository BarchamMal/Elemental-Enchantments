# (Completed) Elemental Enchantments

## Hi there!
This is the repository for (Completed) Elemental Enchantments, a mod with few downloads and fewer features. I made this "mod" (It's not a mod. It's a Data Pack + a Resource Pack) on a whim. That's probably noticable, but I don't know. This pack (Can I just call it that from now on?) is simple. It completes Elemental (and non-Elemental) enchantments. Things like Flame, Fire Aspect, Fire Protection, Smite, and Frost walker now have competitors. There's jokes and puns of course, and bugs I'm sure. Now, this pack was created in like two days, so I never put a description up here till now. Lemme say a few things:
 1. Thanks to all the people who downloaded this, it really shows me that the simpler the content, the better it's loved.
 2. Wow! It got a lot more downloads than I expected.
 3. I don't know when I'll make the Forge edition. It would be easier than talking if I knew forge--and will be for you if you do--but I don't. So the forge edition will be coming out in exactly an unclear amount of time. Thank you for your patience.

## Want to help?
Didn't think so. Wait, you do? Well, didn't expect that! If you want to, think up an enchantment which needs a competitor, either make the competitor yourself, or just open an issue about it. Thanks for the help if you create one yourself and pull request. Thanks for the idea if you give me the think.

## Credits (at the end as usual)
Well, it was all me I think, along with those players who reported bugs. Thanks to you if you're reading this!
